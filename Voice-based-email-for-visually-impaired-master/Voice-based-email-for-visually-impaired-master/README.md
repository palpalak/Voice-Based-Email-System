# Voice-based-email-for-visually-impaired
The application will be a python-based application for visually impaired persons using speech to text voice, thus enabling everyone to control their E-mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform the other useful tasks. The system will give the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same. The main benefit of this system is that the use of mouse is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice and keyboard click only.
